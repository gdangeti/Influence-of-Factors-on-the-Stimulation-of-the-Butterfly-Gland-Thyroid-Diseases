Influence-of-Factors-on-the-Stimulation-of-the-Butterfly-Gland-Thyroid-Diseases

Purpose:
The data functionally comprehends about the incidence of thyroid hormone imbalances among indicated cohort groups and could predict the future risk of complications like goiter and thyroid cancers. The treatment statistics provided, aids in evaluating the medication adherence of people suffering from the thyroid complications.

Summary:
The exploratory data analysis conducted on the dataset helped us gain a deeper insight into the relationship between our independent variables and target conditions. Although no significant relationship was found between the independent categorical and target variables, a strong relationship was seen between the continuous independent variables and the target conditions. The plotted Continuous Variables which mainly consisted of hormonal levels with respect to Target conditions showed fluctuations in hormonal levels impacted the hypothyroid vs hyperthyroid conditions. The non-parametric Wilcoxon test on Hormone levels vs target conditions further proved our hypothesis that hormonal variations affect the prognosis of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. It can be observed that using the prediction models we can predict the target conditions using the provided independent variables. Amongst all the models, XG boost had an accuracy rate of 99.8%. The model did a better job in dealing with our research problem since it can handle missing values and can perform exceptionally well when there is highly imbalanced data. We conclude from our analysis that there is a strong association between the target conditions (negative, hypothyroid, and hyperthyroid) and our independent variables age, TSH, T3, FTI, TT4, and T4U. A significant difference is seen in the presence of the target conditions among various cohorts of gender and age.
